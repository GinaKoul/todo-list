cd todo-list
```

```

Once the dependencies are installed, you're all set to start working on the project!

### Development Instructions

During development, you can use the following command to start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will compile and bundle your assets, launching a local development server.\
The project will be accessible in your browser at http://localhost:8080 by default.\
It automatically reloads the page whenever you make changes to the source files.

### Deployment Instructions

Once you've finished development and are ready to deploy your changes, follow these steps:

#### Before Commit

1. Check conflicting rules between eslint and prettier

```bash
npm run test-rules
```

2.  Scan code with style rules of eslint

```bash
npm run scan
```

3.  Check that files are already formatted

```bash
npm run test-format
```

4. Format all files with prettier

```bash
npm run format
```

#### Commit

1. Add all changes:

```bash
git add .
```

2. Commit your changes:

```bash
git commit -m "<Your commit message>"
```

3. Push your changes to the main branch:

```bash
git push origin main
```

4. Check the status: Make sure there are no uncommitted changes by running:

```bash
git status
```

#### After Commit

1. Deploy the changes. Run the following command to deploy:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will push the compiled and minified assets to the [gh-pages](https://github.com/GinaKoul/todo-list/tree/gh-pages) branch.
